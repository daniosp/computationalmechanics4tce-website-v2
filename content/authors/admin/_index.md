Driven by continuous learning focused on applications that blend engineering with new technologies, I have been drawn to research and education. Thanks to this approach, I have acquired technical skills in the use of computer-aided engineering tools as well as various programming languages. I enjoy experiences that allow me to refine both my technical and interpersonal skills in the academic field.
